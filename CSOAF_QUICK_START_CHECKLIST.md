---

## ESCALATION POINTS

### Escalate to Leadership If:

- No responses from major funders within 2 weeks of outreach
- Consistent feedback that CSOAF is "not the right fit"
- Required documentation not available (e.g., audit, 501(c)(3))
- Organizational budget constraints prevent program implementation
- Staff capacity insufficient for applications
- Technical barriers to grant portals

### Escalate if Uncertain:
- Funder requirements seem unclear
- Application is significantly over/under word limits
- Budget doesn't align with program costs
- Program-funder fit is questionable

---

## FINAL NOTES

### Remember:
1. **Quality over speed** - Better to submit one excellent application than three weak ones
2. **Relationships matter** - Funder contact and relationship development are critical
3. **Documentation is key** - Clear, compelling documentation of impact wins grants
4. **Persistence pays** - First applications rarely succeed; keep applying
5. **Celebrate wins** - Acknowledge successes and learn from any rejections

### You've Got This
With 28+ verified funders identified and detailed strategy documents provided, CSOAF is well-positioned for funding success. Focus on the top 5 immediate priorities, execute the 30-day plan, and success will follow.
