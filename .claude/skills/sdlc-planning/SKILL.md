# SDLC Planning Skill

## When to Use This Skill
- Starting a new feature
- Planning major changes
- Creating technical specifications
- Identifying requirements
- Planning architecture

## Planning Workflow

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Identify stakeholders:** Who will use this feature?
- **Functional requirements:** What must the feature do?
- **Non-functional requirements:** Performance, security, scalability
- **Acceptance criteria:** How do we know it's complete?

### 2. Specification Writing
Create a detailed spec document with:
- **Problem statement:** What problem are we solving?
- **User stories:** As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
- **Data models:** What data structures are needed?
- **API contracts:** What are the inputs/outputs?
- **Edge cases:** What could go wrong?

### 3. Architecture Planning
- **Component diagram:** What are the major components?
- **Technology choices:** What tools/libraries?
- **Integration points:** How does it connect to existing system?
- **Scalability:** How will it handle growth?

### 4. Risk Assessment
- **Technical risks:** What could fail?
- **Mitigation strategies:** How do we prevent failures?
- **Complexity estimate:** How long will this take?
- **Dependencies:** What do we need first?

## Output Format

Create a planning document with:
1. Executive Summary
2. Requirements (Functional & Non-Functional)
3. User Stories
4. Architecture Diagram (text-based is fine)
5. Data Models
6. Risk Assessment
7. Timeline Estimate
8. Success Metrics

## Example Usage

Input: "Plan a CSV export feature for sponsor results"

Output:
- Requirements document
- User stories
- Architecture plan
- Risk assessment
- Timeline estimate
