## SECTION 9: CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### MUST-DO ACTIONS (Non-negotiable)

1. **NAMI-NYC Partnership (This Week):** This is the single most important action. NAMI-NYC unlocks access to 4-5 corporate sponsors and provides credibility within NYC mental health ecosystem.

2. **Professional Grant Writing (IMMEDIATE):** Hire or assign professional grant writer. Quality applications are 2-3x more likely to succeed. Budget: $3K-$5K for first round (ROI easily $500K+).

3. **Relationship-Building Before Applications:** Don't just submit cold applications. Call program officers at major foundations, schedule informational meetings, build familiarity.

4. **Deadline Calendar & Tracking:** Create master deadline spreadsheet. Track all deadlines obsessively. Missed deadlines = missed funding.

5. **Outcome Measurement Framework:** Funders increasingly require metrics. Develop outcome measurement capability now while building relationships.
