## RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATIONS

### Potential Risks
1. **Invitation-only foundations** (Illumination Fund) - MITIGATION: Build relationships early
2. **Competitive process** (national foundations) - MITIGATION: Excellent proposal + strong data
3. **Government funding cycles** (NYS OMH) - MITIGATION: Monitor closely; prepare ahead
4. **Timeline delays** (typical 3-6 months) - MITIGATION: Start immediately; diversify targets
5. **Grant rejection** - MITIGATION: Apply to 8-10 organizations; have backup strategies

### Contingency Planning
- **If national foundations slow:** Focus on local/regional foundations
- **If government RFP delayed:** Accelerate corporate and foundation applications
- **If single grant denied:** Multiple applications ensure diversity
- **Budget: Plan for 40-50% success rate across all applications
